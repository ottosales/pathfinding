# RTS studies

This repo contains a series of studies and tests I made towards building rts controls.
The repo name is because it all started as a simple A* study

Things I already started doing / finished doing:
- World to grid generation
- Unwalkable terrain
- Pathfinding using heap optimization
- Player movement
- Character animations
- Path correction when clicking in ulwalkable terrain
- Camera movement: moving mouse close to borders
- Camera movement: stick to character
- Camera movement: zoom in / out

TODO:
- Recognize and target other creatures
- Attacks
- Skills
- FX through particle systems and shaders
